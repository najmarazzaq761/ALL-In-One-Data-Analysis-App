# ALL-In-One-Data-Analysis

ðŸŒŸ Exciting News! ðŸŒŸ

Introducing ALL-In-One-Data-Analysis!

I'm thrilled to share my latest project - a Streamlit app designed to streamline the data analysis process! 

This app offers a comprehensive suite of features to make data analysis more accessible and efficient:

ðŸ”¹ **Data Upload or Load from Seaborn**: Choose to upload your own dataset or select from popular Seaborn datasets like Titanic, Iris, and more.

ðŸ”¹ **Data View**: Get a quick overview of your data, including the head, shape, summary statistics, and column data types.

ðŸ”¹ **Missing Values Imputation**: Easily handle missing data by imputing values based on mean, median, mode, or custom values, all selected on a per-column basis.

ðŸ”¹ **Data Visualization**: Create stunning visualizations with a variety of plot types (line, scatter, hist, KDE, box, violin, count, bar) based on your selected features.

ðŸ”¹ **Feature Engineering**: Drop selected columns and perform label encoding to prepare your data for modeling.

ðŸ”¹ **Model Selection**: Choose from a range of models for both classification (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes, SVC) and regression (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, SVR).

ðŸ”¹ **Training Model and Evaluation**: Train your selected model and evaluate its performance with metrics like accuracy or mean squared error.

This app is designed to help data scientists, analysts, and enthusiasts to streamline their workflow and gain deeper insights from their data.

Check it out and let me know what you think! Your feedback and suggestions are most welcome. ðŸ™Œ
